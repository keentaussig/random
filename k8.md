## Dive into K8 

### K8
* **What is Kubernetes?** system for running many different containers over multiple different machines;
* **Why?** When needed to run multiple different containers with different images;
* **Cluster** assembly of a master and one or more nodes, which can be used to run different sets of containers;
* **Install kubectl** on linux: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl-on-linux
* **Install minikube** https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/
* **Install homebrew** on linux https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux
* <optional> `brew install docker-machine-driver-vmware`
* start minikube and check the status
```
minikube start --alsologtostderr -v=7
minikube status
kubectl cluster-info
```
* if error `VT-x is disabled in the BIOS for both all CPU modes (VERR_VMX_MSR_ALL_VMX_DISABLED)` enable CPU virtualization advanced setting in BIOS 

### Docker Compose -> Kubernetes
* [DC] Each entry can optionally get docker-compose to build an image -> [K] Kubernetes expects all images to already be built
* [DC] Each entry represetns a container we want to create -> [K] One config file per *object* we want to create
* [DC] Each entry defines the networking requirements (ports) -> [K] We have to manually set up all networking
