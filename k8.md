### Setup without kubernetes (Elastic Beanstalk)
```
            containers:
browser -->   nginx
            /       \
           V          V
         server    client
             worker
             
             data services:
             - redis 
             - postgres
```
How do we scale it?

```
            containers:
browser -->   nginx
            /       \
           V          V
         server    client
   worker1   worker2    worker3
             
             data services:
             - redis 
             - postgres
```
Or
```
browser -->    load balancer  -->


-->           nginx
            /       \
           V          V
         server    client
             worker

-->           nginx
            /       \
           V          V
         server    client
             worker

-->           nginx
            /       \
           V          V
         server    client
             worker

```
